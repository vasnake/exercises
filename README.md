## dbt (and snowflake)

- Oct 30, 11:30, snowflake lab "build data products and a data mesh with dbt cloud"

data mesh: It is about small teams, they own data products, use dbt (data product management: contracts, versions, security) over snowflake (storage, compute). Teams use each other products.
It's like a software engineering, only it is data engineering.

Demonstration: how to use dbt with snowflake to build and manage "data products":
a few custom marts with data-contracts, cross-team dependencies, access control, etc.
